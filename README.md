# Asteroid

A simple game made live on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/live/-3lkpfmFL5o?feature=share) using Godot 3.5.1, now ported to Godot 4.0

The master branch is the latest up to date branch, using Godot 4 and with the juice added.

If you want the 3.5 version, checkout the **3.5 branch**.
If you want the base game, without the juice, checkout the **base_game_godot_4 branch**.
